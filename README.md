# ocr-bench

**There is currently no single best OCR model.** Rankings change depending on your documents. Manuscript cards, printed books, historical texts all produce different winners.

`ocr-bench` allows you to create **per-collection leaderboards** using a VLM-as-judge approach, so you can find what works best for _your_ documents rather than relying on generic benchmarks. You can validate the VLM's judgement with human votes, and share results via the Hugging Face Hub.

The underlying OCR model inference uv scripts are available at [uv-scripts/ocr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/ocr). The majority of these use vLLM for efficient GPU inference, and are designed to run on a single consumer GPU (e.g. 24GB 3090/4090). The `ocr-bench` package orchestrates running these models at scale on the Hub, and judging outputs with a VLM. If you just want to run some OCR models on your data without the judging/leaderboard aspect, you can run the scripts directly.

## Why?

Generic OCR benchmarks tell you which model wins _on average_. But if you're digitising 18th-century encyclopaedias, that average doesn't help — the best model for your documents might be the worst on someone else's. Inspired by [Datalab's Benchmarks + Evals](https://www.datalab.to/blog/datalab-benchmarks-evals) approach — pairwise VLM-as-judge with Bradley-Terry scoring on your own documents — ocr-bench brings this idea to the Hugging Face Hub as an open-source, self-serve tool.

ocr-bench lets you run the same set of OCR models on a sample of _your_ collection, then uses a vision-language model to judge which produces the best transcription for each document. The result is a leaderboard specific to your data.

| Model              | BPL card catalog | Britannica 1771 |
| ------------------ | :--------------: | :-------------: |
| GLM-OCR (0.9B)     |    #2 (1535)     |  **#1** (1787)  |
| LightOnOCR-2 (1B)  |  **#1** (1559)   |    #2 (1780)    |
| FireRed-OCR (2.1B) |        —         |    #3 (1551)    |
| DeepSeek-OCR (4B)  |    #4 (1452)     |    #4 (1437)    |
| dots.ocr (1.7B)    |    #3 (1453)     |    #5 (945)     |

Rankings can flip completely between collections.

## Hub-native by design

The entire evaluation loop lives on the Hugging Face Hub:

1. **Your dataset** on the Hub (images + optional ground truth)
2. **OCR models** run via [HF Jobs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/jobs-overview) → outputs written as PRs on a Hub dataset
3. **VLM judge** via [HF Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index) — only needs an HF token
4. **Results** published to a Hub dataset (leaderboard + pairwise comparisons)
5. **Viewer** as a [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for browsing and human validation

No local GPU required. Everything is shareable via Hub URLs.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv pip install ocr-bench[viewer]

# 1. Run OCR models on your dataset
ocr-bench run <input-dataset> <output-repo> --max-samples 50

# 2. Judge outputs pairwise with a VLM
ocr-bench judge <output-repo>

# 3. Browse results + validate
ocr-bench view <output-repo>-results
```

### One command

Or chain all three stages in a single call — the fastest way to try ocr-bench on a new collection:

```bash
ocr-bench bench <input-dataset> <output-repo> --max-samples 50
```

`bench` runs the models (waiting for the jobs to finish), judges the outputs, then opens the viewer. It threads the shared flags through each stage: `--models`, `--judge-model` (repeatable for a jury), `--max-samples`, `--seed`, `--adaptive-strategy`, `--size-tie-ratio`, `--no-publish`, and `--port`/`--host` for the viewer. Reach for the individual subcommands when you want finer control over a single stage.

## How it works

**`ocr-bench run`** launches OCR models on your dataset via [HF Jobs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/jobs-overview). Each model writes its output as a PR on the same Hub dataset, keeping everything together without merge conflicts.

**`ocr-bench judge`** runs pairwise comparisons using a VLM judge (default: [Qwen3.5-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B) via HF Inference Providers). For each document, the judge sees the original image and two OCR outputs (anonymised as A/B) and picks the better transcription. Results are fit to a [Bradley-Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) to produce ELO ratings with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. Adaptive stopping halts early when rankings are statistically resolved.

The historical `balanced` adaptive strategy judges every model pair in each five-page batch. Large model grids can opt into targeted allocation once the run has enough balanced evidence to compute an initial board:

```bash
ocr-bench judge <output-repo> \
  --adaptive-strategy targeted \
  --size-tie-ratio 3
```

`targeted` tops up only adjacent pairs whose confidence intervals remain unresolved. The optional size rule applies to **either** adaptive strategy: it can satisfy the whole-run stopping condition in `balanced` mode, while `targeted` also stops topping up that pair. It activates once the pair has at least 10 direct comparisons and one model has at least 3× fewer parameters. The leaderboard marks the smaller model as a practical deployment preference; this does **not** alter ELO/rank or claim the models are statistically equivalent. Unknown/custom model sizes simply remain unresolved. Both settings are recorded in results metadata.

Targeted allocation is experimental and remains opt-in because it conditions later sampling on interim rankings; ordinary bootstrap CIs do not fully account for that optional stopping and may be somewhat optimistic. The default remains `balanced` while targeted allocation is validated.

To avoid wasting judge calls on uninformative pairs, the judge skips comparisons where **both** outputs are shorter than `--min-chars` (default 20 — neither model produced meaningful text), and scores **identical** outputs as an automatic tie without calling the judge. Pass `--min-chars 0` to disable the length filter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If an existing results repository was judged with an older `ocr-bench`
> checkout from output configs containing multiple appended `inference_info`
> entries, run the first upgraded evaluation with `--full-rejudge`. Older
> versions could pair the latest model identity with an earlier OCR text
> column, and their incremental skip data does not record enough provenance to
> distinguish those verdicts safely.

**`ocr-bench view`** serves a local web viewer with a leaderboard, comparison browser, and human validation. Vote on comparisons to cross-check the automated judge with human judgement.

## Available models

ocr-bench ships with 16 registered OCR models. Five form the default set:

| Model           | Size | Best for                   | Notes                        |
| --------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `glm-ocr`       | 0.9B | Historical printed text    | Top performer on Britannica  |
| `lighton-ocr-2` | 1B   | Card catalogs, manuscripts | Top performer on BPL         |
| `firered-ocr`   | 2.1B | Clean printed text         | Mid-pack on degraded docs    |
| `deepseek-ocr`  | 4B   | Diverse documents          | Most consistent across types |
| `dots-ocr`      | 1.7B | General                    | Struggles on historical text |

The opt-in registry also includes compact models at different quality/cost points, including `falcon-ocr` (0.3B) and `ovis-ocr2` (0.9B). List every available model with:

```bash
ocr-bench run --list-models
```

All model scripts are available at [uv-scripts/ocr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/ocr) on the Hub.

By default all 5 models in the table run. To pick specific models:

```bash
ocr-bench run <dataset> <output> --models tesseract falcon-ocr ovis-ocr2
```

## Status

Working proof of concept. The core pipeline (run → judge → view) is functional. Not polished production software — expect rough edges. This is an early-stage project to explore the idea of VLM-judged OCR leaderboards, and gather feedback on the concept and implementation!
