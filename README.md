# ocr-bench

**There is currently no single best OCR model.** Rankings change depending on your documents. Manuscript cards, printed books, historical texts all produce different winners.

`ocr-bench` allows you to create **per-collection leaderboards** using a VLM-as-judge approach, so you can find what works best for _your_ documents rather than relying on generic benchmarks. You can validate the VLM's judgement with human votes, and share results via the Hugging Face Hub.

The underlying OCR model inference uv scripts are available at [uv-scripts/ocr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/ocr). The majority of these use vLLM for efficient GPU inference, and are designed to run on a single consumer GPU (e.g. 24GB 3090/4090). The `ocr-bench` package orchestrates running these models at scale on the Hub, and judging outputs with a VLM. If you just want to run some OCR models on your data without the judging/leaderboard aspect, you can run the scripts directly.

## Why?

Generic OCR benchmarks tell you which model wins _on average_. But if you're digitising 18th-century encyclopaedias, that average doesn't help — the best model for your documents might be the worst on someone else's. Inspired by [Datalab's Benchmarks + Evals](https://www.datalab.to/blog/datalab-benchmarks-evals) approach — pairwise VLM-as-judge with Bradley-Terry scoring on your own documents — ocr-bench brings this idea to the Hugging Face Hub as an open-source, self-serve tool.

ocr-bench lets you run the same set of OCR models on a sample of _your_ collection, then uses a vision-language model to judge which produces the best transcription for each document. The result is a leaderboard specific to your data.

| Model              | BPL card catalog | Britannica 1771 |
| ------------------ | :--------------: | :-------------: |
| GLM-OCR (0.9B)     |    #2 (1535)     |  **#1** (1787)  |
| LightOnOCR-2 (1B)  |  **#1** (1559)   |    #2 (1780)    |
| FireRed-OCR (2.1B) |        —         |    #3 (1551)    |
| DeepSeek-OCR (4B)  |    #4 (1452)     |    #4 (1437)    |
| dots.ocr (1.7B)    |    #3 (1453)     |    #5 (945)     |

Rankings can flip completely between collections.

## Hub-native by design

The entire evaluation loop lives on the Hugging Face Hub:

1. **Your dataset** on the Hub (images + optional ground truth)
2. **OCR models** run via [HF Jobs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/jobs-overview) → outputs written as PRs on a Hub dataset
3. **VLM judge** via [HF Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index) — only needs an HF token
4. **Results** published to a Hub dataset (leaderboard + pairwise comparisons)
5. **Viewer** as a [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for browsing and human validation

No local GPU required. Everything is shareable via Hub URLs.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv pip install ocr-bench[viewer]

# 1. Run OCR models on your dataset
ocr-bench run <input-dataset> <output-repo> --max-samples 50

# 2. If human transcriptions exist, compute exact CER/WER
ocr-bench score <output-repo> --reference-column reference

# 3. Judge outputs pairwise with a VLM
ocr-bench judge <output-repo>

# 4. Browse results + validate
ocr-bench view <output-repo>-results
```

### One command

Or chain all three stages in a single call — the fastest way to try ocr-bench on a new collection:

```bash
ocr-bench bench <input-dataset> <output-repo> --max-samples 50
```

When ground truth exists, add `--reference-column reference` to score it before judging. `bench` runs the models (waiting for the jobs to finish), optionally computes CER/WER, judges the outputs, then opens the viewer. It threads the shared flags through each stage: `--models`, `--judge-model` (repeatable for a jury), `--reference-column`, `--metric-text-mode`, `--max-samples`, `--seed`, `--adaptive-strategy`, `--size-tie-ratio`, `--no-publish`, and `--port`/`--host` for the viewer. Reach for the individual subcommands when you want finer control over a single stage.

## How it works

**`ocr-bench run`** launches OCR models on your dataset via [HF Jobs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/jobs-overview). Each model writes its output as a PR on the same Hub dataset, keeping everything together without merge conflicts.

**`ocr-bench score`** computes corpus-level Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) when the source has a ground-truth transcription column. It uses the same flat/config/PR discovery and alignment checks as the judge, but requires no judge model or API call:

```bash
ocr-bench score <output-repo> --reference-column reference
```

By default, known HTML is flattened, Unicode is canonicalised, and whitespace is collapsed so line wrapping does not dominate the score; case and punctuation remain significant. Use `--metric-text-mode raw` for format-sensitive scores. Failed OCR sentinels count as empty predictions rather than being dropped. The published `metrics`, `metric_details`, and `metric_metadata` configs preserve aggregate scores and provenance alongside any VLM leaderboard.

**`ocr-bench judge`** runs pairwise comparisons using a VLM judge (default: [Qwen3.5-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B) via HF Inference Providers). For each document, the judge sees the original image and two OCR outputs (anonymised as A/B) and picks the better transcription. Results are fit to a [Bradley-Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) to produce ELO ratings with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. Adaptive stopping halts early when rankings are statistically resolved.

The historical `balanced` adaptive strategy judges every model pair in each five-page batch. Large model grids can opt into targeted allocation once the run has enough balanced evidence to compute an initial board:

```bash
ocr-bench judge <output-repo> \
  --adaptive-strategy targeted \
  --size-tie-ratio 3
```

`targeted` tops up only adjacent pairs whose confidence intervals remain unresolved. The optional size rule applies to **either** adaptive strategy: it can satisfy the whole-run stopping condition in `balanced` mode, while `targeted` also stops topping up that pair. It activates once the pair has at least 10 direct comparisons and one model has at least 3× fewer parameters. The leaderboard marks the smaller model as a practical deployment preference; this does **not** alter ELO/rank or claim the models are statistically equivalent. Unknown/custom model sizes simply remain unresolved. Both settings are recorded in results metadata.

Targeted allocation is experimental and remains opt-in because it conditions later sampling on interim rankings; ordinary bootstrap CIs do not fully account for that optional stopping and may be somewhat optimistic. The default remains `balanced` while targeted allocation is validated.

To avoid wasting judge calls on uninformative pairs, the judge skips comparisons where **both** outputs are shorter than `--min-chars` (default 20 — neither model produced meaningful text), and scores **identical** outputs as an automatic tie without calling the judge. Pass `--min-chars 0` to disable the length filter.

**`ocr-bench view`** serves a local web viewer with a leaderboard, comparison browser, and human validation. Vote on comparisons to cross-check the automated judge with human judgement.

When exact metrics and VLM results share a results repository, the viewer shows CER/WER beside judge ELO. This makes disagreements between edit-distance scores and preference judging visible rather than collapsing them into one number.

### Kat57 ground truth

[`experiments/kat57`](experiments/kat57) contains a bounded-memory converter for Lund University Library's [Kat57 PAGE XML release](https://zenodo.org/records/14679534). It turns the 10,695 manually transcribed catalogue cards into a Hugging Face image-and-reference dataset suitable for `ocr-bench run` and `ocr-bench score`.

## Available models

ocr-bench ships with 16 registered OCR models. Five form the default set:

| Model           | Size | Best for                   | Notes                        |
| --------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `glm-ocr`       | 0.9B | Historical printed text    | Top performer on Britannica  |
| `lighton-ocr-2` | 1B   | Card catalogs, manuscripts | Top performer on BPL         |
| `firered-ocr`   | 2.1B | Clean printed text         | Mid-pack on degraded docs    |
| `deepseek-ocr`  | 4B   | Diverse documents          | Most consistent across types |
| `dots-ocr`      | 1.7B | General                    | Struggles on historical text |

The opt-in registry also includes compact models at different quality/cost points, including `falcon-ocr` (0.3B) and `ovis-ocr2` (0.9B). List every available model with:

```bash
ocr-bench run --list-models
```

All model scripts are available at [uv-scripts/ocr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/ocr) on the Hub.

By default all 5 models in the table run. To pick specific models:

```bash
ocr-bench run <dataset> <output> --models tesseract falcon-ocr ovis-ocr2
```
